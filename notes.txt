DISCO:
ArrayList has a lot of built in functions like add() and remove(). 
QCC
are there more effecient ways of sorting an ArrayList?
*/

our order method is not the most effecient one, as it runs through the same for loop numerous times. Though it was the simplest to think about in our opinion. 

the skeleton was of great shock to us. binary was tough.
